#Possible Protocol 1 (PP1): roll once; if get 6 then conclude the dice is not fair; if roll any other number then conclude it is fair. 
dice.roll <- sample(1:6, size = 1, replace = TRUE)
dice.roll
x <- dice.roll
if(x > 5) {
  print("not fair")
} else {
  print("fair")
}
#Analyze PP1: if the dice were fair, what is the probability it would be judged to be unfair?
#there are 5/6 chances for it to be numbers 1-5 , which would deem the die fair . There are 1/6 chances the die is fair. 
#Oppositely, if the dice were unfair, what is the probability that it would be judged to be fair?
#the dice is only being rolled once, if the die were unfair where it would only roll 6 , there is a not enough data to determine wether it was fair or unfair based on the roll.

#PP2: roll the dice 30 times. 
#Group can specify a decision rule to judge that dice is fair or unfair: If the number 6 appears  more than 9 times then the die is fair, otherwise it is not 
#Consider the stats question: if fair dice are rolled 30 times, what is likely number of 6 resulting?
#if a dice is rolled 30 times there is a 1/6 chance that each roll will be a 6, therefore (1/6)*30 =5
#you expect about 5 rolls to be a 6 
dice.roll <- sample(1:6, size = 30, replace = TRUE)
dice.roll
numbers<-c(dice.roll)

#How unusual is it, to get 1 more or less than that? 
#How unusual is it, to get 2 more or less?
#3?
# Each die roll is an indepent event , this means what I roll in each try has nothing to do with what comes before or after 
#to determine how unusual it is , it would be based on a parameter set by the group that if it appears more than 9 times then it is unfair. When calculating what the mean would be if there were exactly 9 6's and the rest were other numbers, we obtain an average of 3.7
# if the die is perfectly fair then the mean would be 3.5 
mean(dice.roll)
x <- mean(dice.roll)
if(x > 3.7) {
  print("not fair")
} else {
  print("fair")
}

#PP3: roll 100 times and specify decision rules. Some cases are easy: if every roll comes to 6 then might quickly conclude. 
#But what about the edge cases? Is it fair to say that every conclusion has some level of confidence attached?
#Where do you set boundaries for decisions? Analyze PP3.
#Hypothesis: if there are more than 22 6's rolled then the dice is unfair also if less than 10 6's are rolled the the dice is also unfair
#null hypothesis: if number of 6's rolled in 100 trials are less than 10 or more than a hundred then the die remains fair

#If you roll a dice 100 times each try there is a 1/6 chance to obtain a 6, if the 100 tries are perfectlt fair then you would expect about 16.666 of your 100 tries to a 6 
#each roll is independent of the next
# a chi  square test measures how well the observed distribution of data fits with the distribution that is expected if the variables are independent. 
#we will look at an alpha level of 5% or .05
