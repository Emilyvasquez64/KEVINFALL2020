#Q2 work on Hawkes
#Q3 Can you write some code in R that will simulate a fair roll?
dice.roll <- sample(1:6, size = 20, replace = TRUE)
dice.roll
temp<-dice.roll==6
temp[1:20]
mean(dice.roll)
#This is due before class “Adjust” the dice or play with the random number generator.
# Can you get them to roll a 6 more or less often than would be expected? How would you know - what is “more often”
# Answer: A fair die means that there is equal chance for each number to come out 1/6 chances for 6 to come out each time
# if you have 20 rolls in a fair dice , then you should get at least 3 sixes
#if you have more than more 3.4444 6's then its unfair, if average of 6's
# in order to make it unfair you can tape some weight to the 1 so its more attracted to the ground and it will sit face down
#the average value is around 3.4 therefore the die is fair
