I will start the Hawkes stat review and will work on it over the coming weeks. 

Question 3
Dice adjustment - I added 3 coins to the one on the dice and it rolls a 6 more often than expected. I know that with the coins tapped to the dice that it rolls a 6 more often because I rolled the dice prior to taping the coins and out of 20 rolls I rolled a 6 3 times. After taping the coins to the dice and rolling the dice 20 times I rolled a 6 14 times. I also simulated a dice roll in R. That simulation produced a 6 2 times out of 20.
