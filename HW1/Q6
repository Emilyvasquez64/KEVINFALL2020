#Differences in means can be complicated. Find the mean return on SP500 index (choose a time period).
# When the previous 2 days were positive? Negative?
# Now read about “hot hands fallacy” and tell if you think that helps investment strategy.
# (You might start with this tweet, and read the papers referenced.)
#We went on  https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/%5EGSPC/history?period1=1597536000&period2=1598745600&interval=1d&filter=history&frequency=1d
#downladed the data and calcuated the mean return from the time period of 8/17-8/28, a 10 day period
#in order to find daily return we will use the foruma ((Adj Close/(previous day Adj close))-1)*100
